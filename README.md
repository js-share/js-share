![JS-Share](https://github.com/js-share/js-share/blob/master/client/public/logo.png)

### The most advanced real time collaboration platform ever created.

Utilizing Google Authentication to verify all users, you will be able to access your own documents while also sharing documents with other users that have signed up.
 
  - Make sure you have the .env file when running the server locally
  - Google OAuth is requrired for you to create and share documents
  - Update code and run it right in the browser

##### New Features!

  - Clean styling using bootstrap 4.0 with minimal CSS
  - Auto-user sharing by typing in multiple valid email addresses

##### You can also:
  - Copy and paste code and run it right in the console and then save it to your personal document within the custom PostgresQL database.  
 
### Steps to get local server running

> npm install from client folder first
> npm install from root/server directory
> npm run dev from root/server directory (make sure .env file is present)
